Title: create static-but-interactive webpages with plotly
Description: Plotly plots (particularly 3D embeddings) are remarkably handy,
             but can be remarkably onerous to customize. Useful color palettes, 
             swappable groupings, a moderate number of swappable dimensions, 
             and linked selections are all somewhat fiddly. plotfly started
             out as a single function and slowly grew into something which made
             more sense as a package. And so here we are.
